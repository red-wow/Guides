# MR OF THE MONTH 
WHAT IS IT AND HOW DOES IT WORK
LEAKING THIS DOCUMENT WILL RESULT IN TERMINATION
----
MR of the Month is given to three MRs who show exemplary dedication, activity, effort, and devotion toward their designated MR rank for the month. One person of each rank will be awarded MR of the Month, which is one head, one manager, and one senior manager.

The MR of the Month is determined in two halves: one half (50%) is determined through session activity (25%) and shift minutes (25%), while the second half (50%) is determined through other contributions done throughout the group.

*Other contributions include but are not limited to:*
Answering questions (All ranks)
Helping people (All ranks)
Doing a good deed (All ranks)
Having a clean disciplinary history for the month [this does not include previous months] (All ranks)
Responding to Group Wall requests (All ranks)
Responding to mod call requests in the Discord server (All ranks)
Reports sent in the reporting channels (Heads)
Moderating the Discord server (Management+)
Answering questions in #questions (Management+)
Reviewing reports (Management+)
Accepting Ban Appeals (Management+)
Reviewing applications (Seniors)
Responding to senior ban requests (Seniors)
(More to be added if I think of more)

The MR of the Month determination process will be done in three stages:


The first stage will start toward the end of the month, once the majority of the MR Team's activity has been completed. The Lookbook creators for that month will review every MR's activity and note any significant MRs who have demonstrated good activity over the course of the month through sessions and shift minutes. Unfortunately, if you put in a lot of contributions but not a lot of sessions or shifts (say, 10 sessions or 10 shifts, etc.), you will probably not be chosen to advance to the next stage because the lookbook creators do not have enough time or many resources to thoroughly review every MR's contributions. We hope you understand.


The second stage will begin once the Lookbook creators have noted down all of the MRs who had significant session and shift activity for the month. This stage is when the Lookbook creators will look over the contributions that the selected MRs have made throughout the month. The Lookbook creators will go through the following contributions listed above for each person to determine which ones will pass on to stage three. Only seven (7) people for Head, seven (7) people for Manager, and four (4) people for Senior will be chosen for stage three. If you have any disciplinary history for the month, such as written warnings or suspensions, you will be ineligible to win MR of the Month, but you may still place 2nd-7th if applicable. Just like in real life, if you were written up, you wouldn't win Employee of the Month!


The third stage will begin once the Lookbook creators have recorded all of the selected MR's contributions. This stage is when the Senior and High-Rank Teams will vote for who they believe deserves MR of the Month through the data the lookbook creators gave them as well as any additional information other Seniors and High-Ranks may have. The data that the lookbook creators will give the Senior and High-Rank Teams will provide them with information on the number of sessions attended, the amount of time shifted, and the contributions that were discovered for each MR selected. The MR with the most votes for head, manager, and senior manager will win and will be awarded with MR of the Month.


The three winners of MR of the Month will be awarded with an exclusive spot in the MR/HR Lookbook and will be given an exclusive Discord role for that month. Additionally, the runner-ups of the MR of the Month will be given a spot on a separate slide to showcase their activity as well. Due to a one-month cooldown, if you win MR of the Month one month, you will not be eligible to win MR of the Month the following month. This is because we want other MRs to have the opportunity to be MR of the Month as well! However, you will still be eligible for 2nd-7th place. Winning MR of the Month does not contribute to promotions, but the activity you have done throughout the month will, of course, still contribute like it always has.


If you have any questions, you are more than welcome to message one of the lookbook creators: cvoryy, w1llowstr, drczzle, or euomaa. Thank you!



Sincerely,

Lookbook Creators
